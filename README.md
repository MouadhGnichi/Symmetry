Translation system for wikipedia content


Wikipedia suffers from content dissmilarity between world language. 
So, the idea here to create translation models with AI to obtain similar content between all languages.

The main tasks made for this app are:

1-Web scraping of Wikipedia Content

2-Text Preprocessing using NLP techniques(Tokenization, Lemmatization, stop words removal...) to extract meaning from each word

3-Content Translation whether using trained model(RNN, LSTM) or pre-trained models(Transformer T5, Marian, Google Translate)

4-Content Semantic Similarity.

5-Recommendation system for the missing content between two languages.

Feel free to run this flask app to better understand the mechanism of the application

1: git clone the project on your machine

2: flask run
